(* After 1D CA we turn to two dimensional CA. Still each cell can \
have two states. BUT
there are now 8 neighbours. 3 above and below and one to the right \
and one to the left. So including the 
middle cell there are 2^9=512 states for these cells. Can you tell \
how many CA rules we then have?
The most famous of these is called Game of Life, \
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life 
and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GameofLife.html *)
(* This example is for rule 746. I call it circular growth. The birth \
rule (white->black) is exactly 3 living neighbours.
Survival (black\[Rule]black) if no more than 4 neighbours are alive. \
Death ( black\[Rule]white) if there are 5-8 living neighbours
in the previous generation. Game of Life is rule 224. Same birth \
condition as for Circular Growth but death happends due to lonliness
(0 or 1 living cell next to the cell) or over population (4-8 living \
cells around the middle cell). As in our world! 
If you write 746 and 224 in base 2 I hope you can figure out how this \
rule numbers are obtained.*)
CircularGrowth = {746, {2, {{2, 2, 2}, {2, 1, 2}, {2, 2, 2}}}, {1, 1}};

seed, with 5 cells but the next lowest is dead (ill) to begin with.
200 iterations. In fact something shocking happends after 3000 \
iterations for this seed. To see it you have to have a big matrix and
it takens around 25 minutes one my machine. For five healthy cells in \
a row this effect has not been seen. It seems like
radius of ball is =C * (number of iterations). Can you estimate C?*)
