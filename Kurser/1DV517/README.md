# LanguageAndLogic
Language and Logic LNU. The subject was funny for me, automata, Turing Machines and logic is fun if you like programming, see it like it is programming in low... low, low, low, low level. However there are some other variables that make this course super difficult to complete. You will see if you take it :smirk: Don't get scared when you see the assignments, is not that difficult when you learn the subject.
