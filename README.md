# Information about General program
You don't need to follow designed programs to get your diploma. Talk with a student counsellor to get more information, but in general. In order to get the general CS diploma you need: 
* 90 credits on computer science (the dv courses)
  * From those 90 credits, at least 2 courses from "2dv~" for instance, Software Engineering or Software testing. 
  * The Final project on CS 
* 90 credits free elective
  * You can do a maximun of 60 credits on computer science courses
  * at least 30 credits should NOT be from computer science
  * If you do 90 credits on a single area (let's say maths) and their final project, you can get two diplomas. 
 If you want to have a Technical diploma you need
 * 90 credits on CS
  * 2 courses advanced (2dv)
  * Thesis
 * 45 credits on the tech faculty
 * 15 credits on math
 * 30 free credits
