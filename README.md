# LNU-Kurser
All the courses I finished at LinneUniversitetet faculty of Computer Science, general program. 

Please be careful, use this to get ideas but don't copy-paste. Teachers and Assistants check github and actually... I'm not that good student anyways. But better something than nothing, I guess.

# Information about General program
Just for you to know. In order to get the general CS diploma you need: 
* 90 credits on computer science (the dv courses)
  * From those 90 credits, at least 2 courses from "2dv~" for instance, Software Engineering or Software testing. 
  * The Final project on CS (That is a "2dv~" course, btw)
* 90 credits free elective
  * You can do a maximun of 60 credits on computer science
  * at least 30 credits should NOT be from computer science
  * If you do 90 credits on a single area (let's say maths) and their final project, you can get two diplomas.
