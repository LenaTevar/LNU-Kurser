VG exercises not done because health "problems" (baby about to born!).

In order to test Stringbuilder append and String concatenation I created
a short string with only one character and a for loop that creates a long
string depending of the value of the variable LONG_STRING_LENGTH (in this
case I used a string with 80 characters).

To check how many strings were added, I creates a variable using
System.currentTimeMillis()+1000. That would give me the one second time lapse
to do the concatenation using a while loop.
Inside this while loop, I tested the string concatenation and the stringbuilder append.

The result was indisputable. StringBuilder made it greatly better than string.
The difference when adding short strings was around 30,000,000 extra characters
 and 170,000,000 extra characters with long strings in my computer.
